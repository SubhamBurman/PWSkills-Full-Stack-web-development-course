    Question 2: Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide 
    an example of how to use comments in an HTML document?
-->

<!--
    Solution:
    The comment tag is used to insert comments in the source code. 
    Comments are used by the programmer to tell the browser 
    that the specific line of text is not be rendered into the website.
    We can use comments to explain our code, which can help us when we edit 
    the source code at a later date.
    Generally, two types of comments exist: single-line comments. multi-line comments.
