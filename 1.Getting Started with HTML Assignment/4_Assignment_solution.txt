Question 4:
Write a short note on tags and elements with an example.

Solution4: 
HTML tags are used to create HTML elements, such as paragraphs or links. 
HTML tags are made up of an opening bracket, the element's name, and a closing bracket. 
Example: <p>...</p>

HTML elements are made up of a starting tag, content, and an end tag. 
For example, <p>This is html element</p>
A paragraph element has a <p> tag, followed by the paragraph 
text, and a closing </p> tag. 

Some elements don't have a closing tag and are called empty elements.
