
Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their 
syntax and examples.

Solution : Loops are another fundamental concept in programming. They allow you to 
execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. This is incredibly 
useful for automating tasks that involve repetitive operations.

1. for Loop
The for loop is often used when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat the 
code. It has three parts within parentheses Initialization, Condition, Increment/Decrement

Syntax:

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // Code to execute repeatedly
}

2.while Loop
The while loop is used when you don't know beforehand how many times you need to repeat the code. It keeps executing the code block as long as a specified condition is true.

Syntax:

while (condition) {
  // Code to execute repeatedly
}

3. do-while Loop

The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block executes at least once, even if the condition is initially false.

Syntax:

do {
  // Code to execute repeatedly
} while (condition);
