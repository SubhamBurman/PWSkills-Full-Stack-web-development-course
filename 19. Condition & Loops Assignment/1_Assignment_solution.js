Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

solution : In programming, conditional statements are fundamental building blocks that 
allow your code to make decisions based on certain conditions. They control the flow of 
execution, determining which parts of your code run depending on whether a specified 
condition is true or false.

Syntex :
if (condition) {
  // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code to execute if the condition is false
}

let isRaining = true;

if (isRaining) {
  console.log("Bring an umbrella!");
} else {
  console.log("Enjoy the sunshine!");
