        and web applications. <br>
        It can range from developing a simple static page to complex web applications, 
        electronic businesses, and social network services. 
        <br>
        <h4>Web development includes: </h4>
         Web design, Web publishing, Web programming, Database management, Markup and 
         coding, Scripting, Network configuration, CMS development. <br>
         Web development is not exactly concerned with the design of a website. 
         Instead, it's all about the coding and programming that powers the website's 
         functionality.
