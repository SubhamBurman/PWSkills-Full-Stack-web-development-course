In JavaScript, operators are categorized based on the number of operands they act upon: unary, binary, and ternary. Here's how each category differs along with examples:

1. Unary Operators:
Unary operators act on a single operand (one value).

Examples:

Unary Plus (+) Operator
Unary Minus (-) Operator
Increment (++) and Decrement (--) Operators
Logical NOT (!) Operator


2. Binary Operators:
Binary operators act on two operands (two values).

Examples:

Arithmetic Operators
Comparison Operators
Logical Operators


rnary operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark ?, an expression to execute if the condition is true, and a colon : followed by an expression to execute if the condition is false.

Example:
let age = 20;

// Ternary Operator
let status = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";

console.log(status);  // "Adult"
