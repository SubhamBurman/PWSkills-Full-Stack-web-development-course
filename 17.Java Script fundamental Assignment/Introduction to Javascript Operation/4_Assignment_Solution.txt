Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts
important?

solution:  Understanding the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript is crucial for 
writing correct and predictable code. These concepts determine the order in which operators are evaluated 
when expressions are parsed and executed. Hereâ€™s an explanation of each concept:

Precedence of Operators:
Operator precedence defines the order in which different types of operators are evaluated in an expression.
 Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence. If operators have the 
 same precedence, their associativity determines the order of evaluation.
 Example of Operator Precedence:
 let result = 10 + 5 * 2;  // Multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+)
console.log(result);  // Output: 20



Associativity of Operators:
Associativity determines the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated. It can be either left-to-right (left associative) or right-to-left (right associative).

Example of Operator Associativity:
let result = 10 - 5 - 2;  // Subtraction (-) is left associative
console.log(result);  // Output: 3
