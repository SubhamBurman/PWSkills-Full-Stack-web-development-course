Question 4: What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you 
declare them using the 'let' keyword?

Answer: In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manipulate data within a program. 
They allow you to assign values to a name (identifier) so that you can refer to and use 
these values throughout your code.
