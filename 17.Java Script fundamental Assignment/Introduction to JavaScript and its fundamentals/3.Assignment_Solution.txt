Question 3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.

Answer: In JavaScript, there are five primitive data types. These are basic data types 
that are not objects and do not have methods. Here's a list and description of each 
primitive data type:

1. Number: Represents numeric data, both integers and floating-point numbers.
Examples, 
let count = 10;        // Integer
let price = 99.99;     // Floating-point number

2. String: Represents textual data, enclosed within single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").
Examples,
let message = 'Hello, World!';
let name = "Alice";

3. Boolean: Represents a logical entity that can have two values: true or false.
Used in conditional expressions and logical operations.
Examples,
let isOpen = true;
let isFound = false;

4.Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value yet.
When a variable is declared without initialization, it is automatically assigned the value undefined.
Example: 
let x;
console.log(x);   // Output: undefined

5.Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
It is often used to explicitly state that a variable has no value.
Example: 
let data = null;


These primitive data types in JavaScript are immutable, meaning their values cannot be 
changed. Operations on primitive data types result in new primitive values rather than 
altering the original values directly. They are stored directly in the allocated memory 
space, which makes them more efficient in terms of memory usage compared to objects.
