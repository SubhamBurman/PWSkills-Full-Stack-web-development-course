Question 5: Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of 
single-line and multi-line comments.

Solution : Comment in JavaScript is very inportant because it help user
to add some information in between the code.
Comment can only be seen in code, and cannot be render into the website.


// This is a single-line comment in JavaScript
let num = 10; // Initialize a variable `num` with value 10

'//' denotes the start of a single-line comment. Anything after // on the same line is 
ignored by the JavaScript interpreter.



/*
   This is a multi-line comment in JavaScript.
   It can span multiple lines.
   These comments are often used for longer explanations or documentation.
*/

let message = "Hello World"; /* Initialize a variable `message`
                                with the string "Hello World" */

/* starts the multi-line comment block, and */ ends it.
Multi-line comments are useful for providing detailed explanations, commenting out 
blocks of code, or temporarily disabling code during debugging.
