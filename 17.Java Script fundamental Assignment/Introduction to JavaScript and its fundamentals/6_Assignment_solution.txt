Question 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names 
in JavaScript. Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.

Solution: Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial 
for several reasons:

Readability: Descriptive variable names make your code easier to read and understand, 
not only for yourself but also for other developers who may need to work with your code 
in the future.

Maintainability: Clear variable names reduce the likelihood of misunderstandings or 
errors when maintaining or modifying code. They help convey the purpose and intent of 
each variable, making it easier to make changes without unintended consequences.

Self-documenting: Well-chosen variable names can act as self-documentation, reducing 
the need for excessive comments to explain what the code does.

Reduced Cognitive Load: When variable names accurately reflect their purpose, developers 
spend less time deciphering code and more time solving problems or implementing new 
features.


Example: 
// Good example: clear and descriptive variable names
let length = 10;
let width = 5;

function calculateRectangleArea(length, width) {
    return length * width;
}

let rectangleArea = calculateRectangleArea(length, width);
console.log(rectangleArea); // Output: 50
