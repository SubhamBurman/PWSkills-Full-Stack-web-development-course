Question1: Explain the usage of ternary operator with syntax and write a program to check whether the number is even
or odd using the ternary operator.

Answer : In javascript ternary operator is used to check the given condition in a 
single line, It is similar to that of conditional operators like if else, but in if 
else we have to write conditions in multiple lines where in ternary operator, we can 
write and check the conditions in single line.

syntex : some conditions ? true statement : false statement.

// to check if a no is even or not/

let no = 26;
let result = no%2===0 ?  true : false;
console.log(result);
