Question 1 : Describe the main differences between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the 
CSS Grid layout model. When would you choose to use one over the other?

Solution: CSS Grid provides two-dimensional layout capabilities, allowing for elements 
to be arranged horizontally and vertically. On the other hand, CSS Flexbox provides 
flexibility, allowing for elements to be placed on a single axis, either horizontally or 
vertically.

Choosing between flexbox and css grid depends on your specific layout requirement.

You might choose flex box when you need to arrange items along a single Axis for example,
when creating navigation bars, header/footer layout or aligning element within a container 
Flexboxbox is great for responsive designs where item can vary in sizes.

You might choose CSS grid when you need to create more Complex two dimensional layout 
with row and column. It's particularly useful when you have a grid-like structure such 
as galleries, forms with multiple fields or any design that requires precise control 
over both rows and columns

In Some cases give you may even combine both flexbox and css grid within a single Layout 
to leverage the strength of each model for different parts of your webpage.
