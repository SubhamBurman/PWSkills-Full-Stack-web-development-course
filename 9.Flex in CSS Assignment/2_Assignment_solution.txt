Question 1: Explain the role of the following key properties in the flexbox layout model.
1. justify content 
1. align item
3. gap
4. flex direction
5. flex wrap

Solution: 
1. Justify content: The justify content property in flexbox used to control the alignment 
of Flex item along the main axis of the flex container. It determines how the extra space 
or insufficient space along the main Axis is distributed. There are several values for 
justify content including flex start, flex end, Centre, space-between, space-evenly and 
space-around.

 2. Align-item: The align-item property control the alignment of Flex item along the 
 cross axis of the flex container. It specifies how item are position within their 
 container along this axis. It accept value such as Flex-start, flex-end, Centre, baseline 
 and stretch.

 3. Gap : The gap property is used to define the space between flex item in both direction, 
 both along the main axis and the cross Axis. It's often applied to the flex container 
 itself. It simplifies spacing and creates consistent gap between item without needing 
 to apply margin to individual items

 4. Flex direction : The flex direction property determine the direction in which flex 
 item are placed within the flex container. It defines the main axis and consequently the 
 layout flow it can have values such as row, row-reverse, column and column-reverse.

 5. Flex wrap: The flex wrap property control weather flex item are allowed to wrap into 
 multiple line within the flex container when they don't fit along the main Axis. It accept
  value like no-wrap, wrap and wrap-reverse.
